# halide-haskell playground

This is a template repo to get started with using [halide-haskell](https://github.com/twesterhout/halide-haskell).

Type

```console
$ nix flake init github:twesterhout/halide-haskell-playground
```

and you're good to go. You can `nix develop` and start hacking or `nix build` to make sure everything works.
